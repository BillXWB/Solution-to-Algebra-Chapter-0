# Solution to Algebra Chapter 0
This is a solution manual for *ALGEBRA, Chapter 0*, an algebra textbook written by Paolo Aluffi. 
The way of introducing abstract algebra in a language of categories appeals to me very much.
So I'm perfectly willing to share my solutions to the exercises in this book. 

As a beginner, I'm trying to make my proof explict and detailed, but unfortunately it seems verbose and tedious sometimes. 
Anyway, I would appreciate it if you can point out my mistakes, big or small.
